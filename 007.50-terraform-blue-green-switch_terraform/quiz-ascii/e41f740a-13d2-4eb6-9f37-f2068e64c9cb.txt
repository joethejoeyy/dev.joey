HOW TO INSPECT INGRESS ROUTING

Command:
kubectl describe ingress diner-ingress

        +-------------+
Client →|   Ingress   |
        +-------------+
             |
             +--> diner-blue Service (v1)
             |
             +--> diner-green Service (v2) (active)

Ingress reveals which Service is currently bound to the host.
It’s like checking a street sign: “Now Serving → Green Diner”.
