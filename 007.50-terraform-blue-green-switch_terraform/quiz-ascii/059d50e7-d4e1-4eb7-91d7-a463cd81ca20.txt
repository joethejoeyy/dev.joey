WHY USE TERRAFORM FOR BLUE/GREEN

Terraform centralizes the switch logic and records which color (blue/green)
is active inside its state. This eliminates human error and ensures rollbacks
are repeatable.

      +-----------------------------+
      | Terraform State File (.tf)  |
      +-----------------------------+
                 |
                 v
      +-----------------------------+
      | variable.active_color=blue  |
      +-----------------------------+
                 |
                 v
      +------------------------------------+
      | Ingress → Service blue → Pods A     |
      | Service green (standby)             |
      +------------------------------------+

Like a traffic light controller — Terraform is the signal system managing
which diner serves customers.
