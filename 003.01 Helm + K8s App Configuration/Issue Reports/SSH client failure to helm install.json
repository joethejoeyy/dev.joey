  "steps": [
    "Found that Docker Desktop stores creds in Windows Credential Manager, which breaks when logging in over SSH.",
    "Fixed it by creating a file-based Docker config at C:\\Users\\parm19\\.docker\\config.json.",
    "Added base64 auth for Docker Hub token manually instead of using credsStore=desktop.",
    "Config.json now looks like:",
    "{ \"auths\": { \"https://index.docker.io/v1/\": { \"auth\": \"cGFybWRlZXBjaGhhYnJhOmRja3JfcGF0X3ZJUllJalM4clhiSEl2ejNDbVotRzFrNHZsdw==\" } } }",
    "After that, `docker run hello-world` and `helm install` with the OCI path both worked.",
    "The remaining Helm error was only 'cannot re-use a name that is still in use', which was resolved by uninstalling the old release or using a new release name.",
    "Uninstall/reinstall workflow:",
    " - Run `helm list` to see existing releases.",
    " - Run `helm uninstall my-redis` to delete a release thatâ€™s blocking reuse of the name.",
    " - Run `helm install my-redis oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/redis` (OCI path) or `helm install my-redis bitnami/redis` (chart repo path) to redeploy cleanly."
  ],
  "resolution": "The real fix was replacing credsStore=desktop with file-based base64 auth in config.json. Both Helm chart repo and Helm OCI installs now work; any 'failed install' errors after that were just due to re-using the same release name.",
