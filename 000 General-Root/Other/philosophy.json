      "title": "Why We Use Linux",
      "phase": "General",
      "purpose": "Explain why Linux is the foundation for all DevOps and infrastructure learning, even for developers coming from Windows or .NET backgrounds.",
      "points": [
        "Most servers, containers, and cloud systems run on Linux.",
        "Learning Linux shows how systems actually behave under the hood.",
        "It removes the GUI layer and teaches cause-and-effect thinking.",
        "Understanding Linux makes you infrastructure-literate, even if you stay in .NET.",
        "It\u2019s the common denominator for DevOps, CI/CD, and cloud work."

      "phase": "General",
      "purpose": "Describe how Tailscale and mobile devices enable secure, portable learning environments.",
      "points": [
        "Tailscale provides a secure, simple network so you can connect anywhere.",
        "Your phone becomes a safe window into your own Linux box.",
        "It proves learning doesn\u2019t need a heavy desktop setup.",
        "It replaces passive screen time with hands-on mental time.",
        "The point isn\u2019t to code from a phone \u2014 it\u2019s to think from anywhere."

      "title": "Why We Use AI and Prompts for Learning",
      "phase": "General",
      "purpose": "Explain how AI-assisted prompting reinforces reasoning and accelerates understanding instead of rote memorization.",
      "points": [
        "Prompts turn learning into reasoning instead of memorizing.",
        "AI helps you form hypotheses, test ideas, and debug logically.",
        "It\u2019s a conversation partner, not a code generator.",
        "Writing good prompts trains clear technical thinking.",
        "Understanding why something works matters more than just running it."

      "title": "Why We Use JSON for Documentation and a Transformation Layer",
      "phase": "General",
      "purpose": "Describe how separating data from presentation saves time and makes documentation portable and diff-friendly.",
      "points": [
        "JSON keeps data and display separate \u2014 clean, machine-readable, and diff-friendly.",
        "No wasted time fighting messy UIs or formatting.",
        "Easy to version-control, merge, or reuse in different viewers.",
        "Focus stays on the content and relationships, not presentation.",
        "The structure mirrors how systems are built \u2014 modular and composable."

    {
      "title": "Why We Use AI and Prompts for Log Documentation",
      "phase": "Intermediate",
      "purpose": "Explain how AI-assisted prompting turns raw system logs into structured, teachable documentation instead of unreadable noise.",
      "points": [
        "AI helps translate raw logs into clear, human-readable summaries.",
        "Prompts make the process interactive \u2014 you explain what you see, not just paste data.",
        "It turns log review into a learning moment, reinforcing system reasoning.",
        "AI highlights patterns, anomalies, and likely causes faster than manual parsing.",
        "Prompts enforce structured thinking \u2014 what happened, why, and what next.",
        "The goal isn't automation; it's understanding system behavior more efficiently.",
        "Summaries can be stored as JSON so logs and insights stay aligned and searchable.",
        "Creates a reusable knowledge base of incidents, cause/effect chains, and fixes."

    {
      "title": "Why We Use Kubernetes Locally (Phase 1)",
      "phase": "Phase 1",
      "purpose": "Explain why the first phase of the labs runs Kubernetes locally instead of starting in the cloud.",
      "points": [
        "Local clusters (Kind, Minikube, or Docker Desktop) let you see how Kubernetes actually works instead of relying on hidden cloud automation.",
        "You can safely experiment, delete, and rebuild without risk or cost.",
        "Running Kubernetes locally provides instant feedback loops for learning core concepts like pods, services, and deployments.",
        "It avoids unnecessary cloud billing and network complexity while you learn fundamentals.",
        "You can inspect each control plane component \u2014 API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager \u2014 and understand their relationships.",
        "Local setup helps you learn networking, service discovery, and health probes in an isolated sandbox.",
        "Working locally builds independence; no corporate or cloud account is needed to start learning DevOps.",
        "The experience transfers directly to production clusters later \u2014 same YAML, same behavior, just scaled up."
