Prompt: "Make me an ASCII diagram with nested rectangles to show Docker hierarchy: host machine at the bottom, Docker daemon inside it, and images, containers, and volumes. Make sure it's clear volumes store data on the host."

*Note 1: "Daemon" means a background service/program. On Windows this is basically 
called a "service". The Docker daemon is the engine that builds, runs, and manages containers.*

*Note 2: Volumes are shown here because while they’re not critical for grasping 
Docker’s basics, they’re super important in practice. Any production app that 
stores data (databases, logs, uploads, configs) will depend on volumes to keep 
that data safe on the host even if containers are deleted or rebuilt.*
